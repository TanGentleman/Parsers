# Parsers
Got a link that has HTML tables? Turn them into .csv files or do so much more!

## Features
- This is a work in progress. Running parse.py on the tests found in tests.py data saves all the found html tables to .csv files in the output folder.
- WIP is a class called Parsnip that allows for integration of multiple parsing algorithms making use of BeautifulSoup and lxml
- This allows for a source url or HTML input, with optional XPATH selections, to be converted and manipulated using Pandas Dataframes
- parse1.py and parse2.py hold the logic for the two custom algorithms.
- Much better documentation soon to come.
